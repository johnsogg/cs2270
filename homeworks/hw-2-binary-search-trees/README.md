Language-specific instructions are found in the respective

There are __loads__ of resources on the web for learning how binary
trees work, and what you might use them for. You might be interested
in
[this tree processing page at CMU](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/15-200/lectures/treeprocessing/index.html)
that gives a fair amount of code examples. It is in psuedocode, but
you should be able to translate it to C++. (Right?)
