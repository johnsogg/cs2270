Homework 1: Linked Lists (15 points)
==========

__Due Friday Jan 25 at 6pm__

_Late assignments are capped at 5 points_

This homework assignment gives you a chance to build a useful,
real-world data structure called a Linked List.

Linked Lists are discussed in the Shaffer text. However, the examples
there are given using advanced object-oriented C++ features. So the
text is accurate and helpful (let me know if it isn't!), the code is
probably a bit cryptic.

[Linked Lists Basics](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf)
from Stanford is remarkably legible, and it helpfully uses a similar
simplified coding technique that we will use in this assignment. The
Stanford examples are actually in pure C, not C++.

One notable difference: in C you might build a new node like this:

	struct node* new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
	
In C++ the way we will do it is a bit different:

	node* new_node = new node;

I'm also adding my slide tutorials on pointers and linked lists to
this homework directory. I showed them in class when we covered linked
lists and pointers. Consult them if you need inspiration.

Getting The Code
------------

Download the source files in the 'cpp' directory for homework 1.

You may get the source code in several ways:

- Clone the 2270 repository with `git clone
  https://github.com/johnsogg/cs2270.git`, then you have the entire
  site on your disk, and you can pull down updates with `git pull`.

- Download each individual file via GitHub (click an individual file,
  then use `Raw`, then save that page)
  
- Copy/Paste: click individual file, select what you want, save it.

Instructions
--------

Implement the following functions in `linked_list.cpp`. Use the
provided Makefile to build your program (cd to where your source code
lives, where the Makefile is, and type `make`). You may compile and
run `linked_list_driver` to see how well it works, or not. 

Note that the driver program is just a good start. It is up to you to
write the test code that convinces you that your code works. Go ahead
and edit the driver file however you like.

__Do not add a `main` function to your `linked_list.cpp` file.__ This
will cause RetroGrade to choke. Use the driver's `main` function to
test things out.

After you've implemented some of the functions like report, init_node, 
and append, this is what the test program does out of the box:

	$ make && ./linked_list_driver
	c++ -g -Wall -Wextra   -c -o linked_list_driver.o linked_list_driver.cpp
	c++  -g -Wall -Wextra -o linked_list_driver linked_list.o linked_list_driver.cpp
	Testing Linked List
	Empty List Contents: 
	Empty List Contents after appending 16: 16 
	Initial List Contents: 5 
	After adding 42: 5 42 
	Should be 42, 32, 99: 5 42 32 99 
	Added 7 and 10: 5 42 32 99 7 10 


The point value for correctly implementing each is given below:

1. init_node = 1 point
1. report = 2 points
1. append_data = 1 point
1. append = 2 points
1. insert_data = 1 point
1. insert = 3 points
1. remove = 3 points
1. size = 1 point
1. contains = 1 point

You must do this assignment in C++.

For extra credit, you can do this in Python or Java. __Note: These
will be released by Tuesday. Sorry for the delay, I will get ahead of
the game as soon as possible.__

Turning In Your Homework
--------

Turn in your assignments using
[RetroGrade](http://retrograde.cs.colorado.edu/). This is our new
automated grading system. You may turn in your assignments as often as
you like and get instant gratification.

Create an account on the RetroGrade server, and be sure to use correct
information---_especially your student ID number_. To turn in an
assignment, just use the file upload box to upload your
`linked_list.cpp` file. Don't mix languages in one upload, though,
unless you like error messages.

Once the due date has passed, the recorded score will be capped at
5/15, however you will still be able to tweak your code to make the
code perfect. This is for all you OCD optimizers out there.

You keep your highest score, so if you have a 12/15 and turn it in
late, that old 12/15 is still your best score.
